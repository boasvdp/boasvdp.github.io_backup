### Currently

I'm a researcher, currently working on my PhD in microbial genomics at the [Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development (AIGHD)](https://www.aighd.org/) and the [Amsterdam UMC, dept of Medical Microbiology](https://www.amc.nl/web/home.htm) in the group of Constance Schultsz. My research focuses on the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), in particular how drug-resistant Escherichia coli spread between humans and other animals, and through international travel. My starting point is always the biological question, and I try to answer these questions using bioinformatics and genomics methods.

###  Background

My university training focused mainly on wet-lab microbiological research, with some dry-lab elements. During internships I found out I was leaning more and more towards dry-lab analyses, and I was fortunate enough to find a PhD position which couples genomics methods to relevant and interesting AMR-focused questions.
