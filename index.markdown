### Currently

I'm a researcher, currently working on bacterial meningitis at the group of Nina van Sorge at Amsterdam UMC and the Netherlands Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis. The main focus is on meningitis caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes* and *Escherichia coli*, but I also work on other organisms as the NRLBM tracks all bacterial meningitic pathogens in the Netherlands. I am finishing up a PhD in microbial genomics at the [Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development (AIGHD)](https://www.aighd.org/) and the [Amsterdam UMC, dept of Medical Microbiology](https://www.amc.nl/web/home.htm) in the group of Constance Schultsz. My starting point is always the biological question, and I try to answer these questions using bioinformatics and genomics methods.

I code mainly in Python, R and am comfortable working on the command line. I try to use Snakemake for a lot of projects and can work in RMarkdown.

###  Background

My university training focused mainly on wet-lab microbiological research, with some dry-lab elements. During internships I found out I was leaning more and more towards dry-lab analyses, and I was fortunate enough to find a PhD position which couples genomics methods to relevant and interesting AMR-focused questions. During my PhD I could fully focus on using genomics to study antimicrobial resistance and the dissemination of *Escherichia coli*.

In my free time, I enjoy walking, cooking and playing games.
